## General Information
- more info about dataset are avalaible here: https://worldhappiness.report/faq/
- The data comes from experts under the heading of the United Nations
- However, selecting data by "regional indicator" into two groups "Western Europe" and "East and Central Europe", as I did, raise issues from Geographical point of view.  For example, doesn´t have Estonia more common with Finland, and North Macedonia with Greece, than Estonia with North Macedonia? And which parameters makes North Cyprus part of Western Europe?  
- The aim of my project is just to learn trough displaying relevant and reasonable plots and graphs and to demonstrate some interesting contexts.



## Technologies Used
- Jupyter Lab
- PyCharm
- Python - version 3.10


## Setup
- In PyCharm, virtual enviroment is installed automatically. For installing Jupyter Lab and external libraries, you can use terminal via running  "pip install 'name_module'" command. Alternatively, you can add this module via IDE.
- If you use different programming enviroment and it supports using terminal directly from it, I recommend to install requirements this way since everything will be saved in right directory in order to avoid problems with running program.
- If you use programming enviroment which doesn´t support direct use of terminal, you will have to install requirements (and run the script) using terminal from your OS. This requires a little more familiarity with command line.


## Usage
- You can start program simply by typing "jupyter lab" command from the right drírectory
